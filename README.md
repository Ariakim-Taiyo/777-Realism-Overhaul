<br>

**Description:** <br>
  777 Realism Overhaul is a plugin for GeoFs that revamps the 777-300ER with new fly-by-wire controls, envelope protection, new sounds, smooth gear tilt, and more minor changes to your flight experience. <br>
<br>

**Features:**<br>


**Control Dampening**; Now controls will feel heavier and less responsive. You can no longer immediately defelct the control surfaces based on yoke position. There is an actuation time.<br>
**New Sounds**; The generic LRX sounds are now replaced by high-quality recordings of the aircraft. <br>
**Alarms**; The aircraft now has realistic alarm feedback, including GPWS callouts.<br>
**Smooth Gear Tilt**; A new, robust form of gear tilt has been implemented, most of the bugs from the previous version are now fixed.<br>
**Flight Envelope Protections**; The new FBW system will keep you from exceeding the operational limits of the aircraft.<br>
**Fly-By-Wire**; The aircraft is now equipped with true-to-life FBW systems, based on simulations of the real thing. It includes a Yaw Damper, Climb holding, roll stabilization, and much more.<br>
**Ground Effect**; The aircraft now has simulated ground effect.<br>
**Smart Tiller and NWS**; The aircraft automatically limits tiller authority above 50kts.<br>
**Spoilers Shake**; Spoilers now shake slightly when deployed at high speeds.
**Physically accurate wing flex and ground bounce**; The wingflex is now lift-based and reacts to hard landings with a satisfying bounce.
